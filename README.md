# <strong><u>File System Project</u></strong>
<em>
<p>This project was created for the "Unix System Programming" course in 4th semester of our college.<p>
<p>This project utilises the concepts of shell programming with file APIs and replicates some common file system commands like copy files, deleting, opening editors etc. All the commands can be found out by typing the following in terminal<p></em>
```
    helpme all
```

<em>
<p> The helpme command can also be used to search for a command and its basic details like apropos in unix</p></em>

### How to run:

<ol>
<li> Download or clone the repsoitory into your home directory. Make sure it is named fileSystemProject</li>
<li> Then change directory
```
    cd fileSystemProject
```
</li>

<li> Enter the following in your terminal

```
    make && source fileSystemProject
```
<p>
The make command compiles all the c++ programs of the project, making our work easier. Otherwise we would have to compile each individual file.
The source command allows us to use our function definitions in bash scripts as command line commands. <strong> reads and executes commands from filename in the<em> current shell</em> environment </strong>
</p>
</li>
<li> That's all for the setup. You can use the helpme commands and start using the commands here </li>
</ol>
